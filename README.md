1: Write a Python script to simulate resource scaling scenarios (horizontal vs. vertical scaling) using simple process/thread creation and control.
2: Develop a Python program to demonstrate the concept of elasticity by simulating workload increase and resource addition.
Implement Virtual Machine (VM) creation and management using libvirt and Python bindings, or simulate virtual machine scheduling.
4: Create a Python script to encrypt and decrypt text data using symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption techniques.
5: Write a Python program to simulate load balancing using round-robin or least-connection algorithm across multiple service instances.
6: Develop a resource monitoring script in Python using psutil to monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage, simulating a cloud monitoring mechanism.
7: Implement a Python-based failover mechanism simulation where service requests are switched between primary and backup instances.
8: Create a Python-based service that replicates a data file across multiple simulated storage nodes, demonstrating data redundancy.
9: Use Python and docker-py or subprocess module to deploy multiple container instances and demonstrate scalability.
10: Develop a Python script to simulate SLA monitoring by measuring response time of service endpoints and checking against defined thresholds.
